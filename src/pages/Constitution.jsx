          <h2>University of Manitoba Economics Society (UM Econ) Constitution</h2>
          <p><strong>First Official Draft:</strong> September 1, 2021</p>
          <p><strong>Amended:</strong> October 20, 2023</p>
          <p><strong>Last Amended:</strong> June 13th, 2025</p>

          <h3>Definitions</h3>
          <p><strong>Community:</strong> the members of the club which are usually the council and its members.</p>
          <p><strong>Conflict of Interest:</strong> This conflict happens when an entity or individual becomes unreliable because of a clash between personal interests and professional duties or responsibilities. Such a conflict occurs when an organization or person has a specific interest in the outcome and serves to gain from it —such as money, status, knowledge, relationships, or reputation—which puts into question whether their actions, judgment, and/or decision-making can be neutral. (Investopedia)</p>
          <p><strong>Council:</strong> any person in power that has any duties or responsibilities to the club such as executives, council members, volunteers, etc.</p>
          <p><strong>Executive:</strong> this is a label for individuals that take up positions at the top of the club's management hierarchy. These individuals are the final decision-makers for the club's business such as Operations, Finance, Events, and Marketing. Regardless of their label internally or externally, if the position is labeled as an executive to UMSU, we will view the individual as an integral position to the club who holds responsibility and oversight.</p>
          <p><strong>Member in good standing:</strong> this is the status of the member with respect to the club's internal conduct and rules whose main purpose is to civilly govern their community.</p>
          <p><strong>Open Club:</strong> These clubs make up a large majority of groups on campus because their memberships are open to any undergraduate or graduate student of the University of Manitoba, so long as no less than two-thirds of the club is undergraduate students.</p>
          <p><strong>Proxy:</strong> A trusted UM Econ member.</p>
          <p><strong>Quorum:</strong> A meeting shall be declared to have a quorum if a simple majority of the club membership is present.</p>
          <p><strong>Signing Authority:</strong> this is a label for specific individuals who have authorization to sign cheques, contracts, or anything legally binding in relation to the club. Usually this is in reference to individuals who have authority to manage and access bank accounts, but it can also be used in UMSU for individuals who can make contracts with UMSU.</p>
          <p><strong>Stakeholder:</strong> a person or group who has a vested interest in an organization and can either affect or be affected by its operations and performance. Examples can be customers, businesses, communities, or governments. (Investopedia)</p>
          <p><strong>Valid reason:</strong> Illness, family emergencies, car trouble, or important appointments</p>

          <h3>Article VII — Executive Officer Dismissal Protocol</h3>
          <p>Executive Officer(s) that fail to uphold their basic duties outlined in Article VI and/or violate any Governance articles are subjected to temporary probation for a performance review. This performance review must be started and conducted by the President and requires a clear written assessment of the officer's performance versus the minimum threshold of the duties that the officer must do as outlined in Article VI. A written assessment must be documented, dated, and stored in case the club is under investigation.</p>

          <p>Criteria and reasoning for dismissal must not be discriminatory by nature and cannot be influenced by a person's race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, record of offences, marital status, family status or disability. Exceptions can only apply if they are legitimate factors that negatively affect performance. In that case, written minutes with a cover letter explanation must be documented when performing this exception. There must always be a clear record and reason for a dismissal.</p>

          <p>If there are no written minutes, written notice, and/or the information presented in the documents are unfaithful before the dismissal, this is considered an unfair dismissal. A club that is under investigation and found to have performed an unfair dismissal(s) will be subjected to disciplinary actions.</p>

          <p>If an executive officer is dismissed, the club must follow proper procedures to fill the vacant position(s).</p>

          <h3>Article VIII — Conflict of Interest</h3>
          <p>A Conflict of Interest is defined as when an entity or individual becomes unreliable because of a clash between personal interests and professional duties or responsibilities. Such a conflict occurs when an organization or person has a specific interest in the outcome and serves to gain from it —such as money, status, knowledge, relationships, or reputation—which puts into question whether their actions, judgment, and/or decision-making can be neutral.</p>

          <p>During an election process, conflicts of interest may arise. When they do, the individual who has professional duties or responsibilities related to organizing the democratic election procedure must identify their conflict of interest and withdraw from the role for that election. This is to guarantee a fair democratic process. Failure to identify the conflict of interest and/or withdraw from the role will be considered a violation to the club's constitution.</p>

          <p>Results from a Democratic Election that had a conflict of interest may be subject to be voided. A rerun of the democratic election without any conflicts of interest may begin again for the open executive position(s).</p>

          <h3>Article IX — Chief Returning Officer Appointment</h3>
          <p>Prior to the election, the Executives agree to appoint a Chief Returning Officer (CRO) to oversee the election. This CRO ensures the election is run competently, fairly, and transparently to its members and UMSU.</p>

          <p>To ensure the election is run fairly and transparently, the CRO must:</p>
          <p>a) Not be a person who is running in the election.</p>
          <p>b) Not have any conflicts of interest with the club's management or electoral candidates.</p>
          <p>c) Be neutral and unbiased about the club and their electoral candidates in their election through their professional duties.</p>

          <p>If a member or members of the executive team appoint CROs with a conflict of interest and continue to run elections with that conflict of interest, this is considered a violation to the constitution.</p>

          <h3>Article X — Chief Returning Officer Duties</h3>
          <p>The duties of the CRO are to:</p>
          <p>a) Oversee and administer the elections for UM Econ.</p>
          <p>b) Publicize the elections to the membership of UM Econ.</p>
          <p>c) Hear and decide on any appeals or complaints related to the elections.</p>
          <p>d) Oversee and administer the electronic system's results for votes of the election.</p>

          <p>c) Nominations for the elected position will last for three days. Candidates who wish to be nominated should inform the CRO during that period and must be a member in good standing of UM Econ at the time of their nomination.</p>
          <p>d) Each nominated candidate is allowed to campaign on behalf of themselves during the campaigning period, which will last for at least a week.</p>
          <p>e) The CRO will collect a brief biography and campaign platform from each candidate and distribute them all to the club's current membership email list of UM Econ prior to voting. This list must be of members from the current academic year and any tampering of this list will void the election results as well as constitute a constitution violation.</p>
          <p>f) Voting will be open for at least two days and will be held through a secure online voting platform. It must be accessible to all members of the club.</p>
          <p>g) The results from the online voting platform will be collected by the CRO. These results will be sent to candidates and UM Econ members.</p>
          <p>h) Each candidate must run on their own merit, meaning no slating or teams are allowed during the election process.</p>

          <p>Any tampering of the democratic voting process outlined here will constitute a violation of the constitution.</p>

          <h3>Article XII — Council Appointment Systems</h3>
          <p>If there are open council position(s) available, positions can be appointed through either a democratic election procedure or an application selection procedure. It is up to the President to decide which procedure will best fit for the club and their community based on the status of the club at the time of council formation.</p>

          <p>Note that the criteria and reasoning for any aspects of the council appointment – such as application, interviews, selection, etc. – must not be discriminatory by nature and should not factor a person's race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, record of offences, marital status, family status or disability. Exceptions can only apply if they are legitimate factors that negatively affect performance. In that case, a cover letter explanation must be documented per exception.</p>

          <p>If it is found that a council appointment was not appointed in good faith and the procedure was not followed, the action will be considered in violation of the constitution.</p>

          <p>f) Control over the UM Econ social media pages and the UM Econ bank account (if one such exists) will be transferred during this period to the incoming President.</p>

          <p>It is imperative that the signing authorities' hand over the club's bank account on a yearly basis. If the executive team fails to take the appropriate and formal steps to transfer this authority, credit scores may be negatively affected by the bank; or the club's bank account may receive other disciplinary action from the financial institution for not taking the proper steps when transitioning their bank accounts.</p>

          <p>The reason this is important is because personal information gets attached to bank accounts. If your name remains attached to a club's bank account after you have finished your term, you may be liable for future actions you have no part in simply because your name was left as an active member of the account.</p>

          <p>If you are unsure about your working relationship and status with the bank, please talk to your bank's appropriate representative and they should be able to provide all the information about your club's bank account.</p>

          <h3>Article XIV — Compliance with UMSU Policies</h3>
          <p>UM Econ will comply with the University of Manitoba Students' Union (UMSU) and follow all its bylaws, policies, procedures, and any mandatory training workshop required. Also, UM Econ will follow the policies and procedures found in the UMSU Student Clubs Policies and Procedures document.</p>

          <p>These bylaws, policies, procedures, and workshops are designed to foster a healthy safe environment in the clubs and protect students. When a club does not follow the bylaws, policies, procedures, or workshops, then a club may be investigated. When being investigated, the club will comply with cooperating and providing the necessary documents as well as information. Any club that acts unfaithfully in the investigation process will be subjected to disciplinary actions.</p>

          <p>If any article in the club's constitution is in direct conflict with this article, then this article will take priority and dismiss the effect of the other conflicting article. This is to ensure that clubs are compliant with UMSU policies which are designed to protect students.</p>

          <h3>Article XV — Compliance with Sexual Violence Prevention Workshop</h3>
          <p>To prevent sexual violence, UM Econ council agrees to attend a sexual violence prevention workshop at UMSU's discretion and direction. UM Econ council agrees to be held accountable for their community's conduct with respect to sexual violence.</p>

          <p>At this workshop, usually hosted by Justice for Women's University of Manitoba Club, UM Econ council agrees to learn, apply, and adapt the content in the workshop towards their own club's community. If the Justice for Women's University of Manitoba Club is absent, UMSU will have full discretion in determining who will host these workshops.</p>

          <p>The completion of the workshop is required before UM Econ can be recognized as a club by UMSU. This requirement must be completed before the end of the Fall semester in the academic year. Exceptions can be made on a case by-case basis based on Student Group Services' discretion such as timing of club renewal.</p>

          <h3>Article XVI — Compliance with University Code of Conduct</h3>
          <p>To foster an inclusive and welcoming community, UM Econ will follow the code of conduct and behaviors expected of the University of Manitoba community outlined by the University of Manitoba Administration.</p>

          <p>Also, UM Econ agrees to foster an environment that does not encourage STUDENT NON-ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT AND CONCERNING BEHAVIOUR outlined by the University of Manitoba.</p>

          <h3>Article XVII — Amendments to Constitution</h3>
          <p>Any changes (amendments) to this constitution must first be presented and reviewed by UMSU Student Group Services to ensure they align with UMSU policy. Once approved by Student Group Services, the constitution must then be approved by a formal vote of the entire student club membership at a publicized meeting. This meeting can be hosted in-person or virtual.</p>

          <p>The student club membership list is generally held by the executive council and the council is responsible for communicating these constitution changes to the members. Failure to communicate these changes and failure to host a publicized meeting qualifies as a violation to the constitution.</p>

          <p>The proposed changes must be made available to all members of the club at least two weeks before the meeting. To vote in favour of the amendment, this vote requires the support of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the members present and voting at the meeting. After the members of the club approve the constitution, a copy of the amended constitution must be submitted to UMSU to be considered officially updated.</p>

          <p>To prevent corruption, governance articles cannot be changed (amended). These articles can only be changed if the change is mandated by UMSU explicitly in writing or the change was first proposed to UMSU by the club's council and the club has received explicit approval of the change by UMSU Student Group Services in writing.</p>

          <h3>Article XVIII — Violations to Constitution</h3>
          <p>When an executive or multiple executives violate(s) the article(s) in this constitution, the following disciplinary actions will come into effect:</p>
          <p>a) To avoid any conflict of interest, UMSU oversees any violations of constitutions. Every situation will be different and thus, UMSU will always have full oversight and discretion regarding what the verdict is, when the verdict takes place, and decide if disciplinary action is necessary. This is to guarantee a fair process and the well-being of students, the club, the overall campus community, and relevant stakeholders. UMSU will be responsible for explaining the violation and the possible repercussions. UMSU will also provide recommendations for how the club can move forward after the violation and consequences are settled.</p>
          <p>b) To maintain equity, the severity of repercussions will depend on the weight of the constitution violation and the specifics of the situation. UMSU will act as a neutral third party in assessing the infringement and will pass down an appropriate conclusion on the matter. This will be based on precedent and UMSU bylaw parameters.</p>
          <p>c) Depending on the severity of the violation, UM Econ may lose our recognition status, club funding, services, benefits, be expelled from UMSU, and/or receive repercussions from relevant stakeholders. Individual executive(s) may be dismissed from their term in office, lose benefits, lose services, expelled from the club, and/or receive personal repercussions from relevant stakeholders. Relevant stakeholders most importantly include the University of Manitoba Administration.</p>

          <p>Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of disciplinary punishments as UMSU will have full discretion regarding the matter.</p>

          <h3>Article XIX — Meetings</h3>
          <p>The President may call an Executive meeting at any time but must give all other members at least 48 hours notice. There shall be at least four official meetings of the club in addition to the regularly scheduled events of UM Econ.</p>

          <p>UM Econ agrees and understands the content above regarding what may happen if they violate their own constitution.</p>
